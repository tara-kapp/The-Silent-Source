# **Technical**

## Overview 

*The Silent Source* is built in **Unity 2021.3.21f1**, leveraging a modular and event-driven architecture to deliver a seamless interactive experience. Scene management organizes the narrative flow across distinct stages, from the introductory cutscene to the main gameplay and reflective end scene, with smooth transitions handled by `SceneManager`. The application features diverse interaction modes through a custom cursor system, allowing users to engage in cutting, petting, or observing objects, all dynamically controlled via scripts like `CursorScript` and `cursorUI`. The `PigManager` oversees the spawning, movement, and removal of pigs, using a queue system to ensure efficient and randomized gameplay. UI components such as dynamic panels (`UIPanelMover`) and hover-based tooltips (`HoverPopUp`) deliver contextual information, while real-time updates to health bars and item descriptions enhance immersion. Particle systems managed by `ParticleSpriteManager` add dynamic visual effects, with smooth animations achieved through coroutine-based interpolation. The application also integrates ambient audio and sound effects triggered contextually to heighten the emotional impact. Progress tracking through the `gameTimer` and `pigsKilledUpdater` scripts calculates gameplay stats, tying into the reflective themes of the experience.

## Scenes

### Start

**Description:**   
Starting screen that offers the user the option to start the program, and then transitions into the Intro\_Cutscene.

### Intro\_Cutscene

**Description:**   
Start animation begins with ominous piano music playing in the background. Ends with a static background image providing a transition into the main scene. 

### Cut\_Scene2.0

**Description:** 

The main scene where the user will spend the majority of their time and where most of the educational and narrative elements are. Includes, the Pig, conveyor belt, items, and background.

### End\_Cutscene

**Description:** 

Closing scene, provides thought provoking text reviewing the prior imagery the user has seen and a dark ever rising statistic about the Pig industry. Allows user to exit or restart the program from this screen. 

## Scripts

* ConveyerRise.cs  
  - Moves a specified sprite object from its starting position to a target position in a specified scene.  
  - Activates movement only in the "Cut\_Scene2.0" scene.  
  - Uses a coroutine for smooth linear interpolation (Lerp) of the sprite's position over time.  
  - Logs warnings if the required sprite object is not assigned.  
* CursorScript.cs  
  - Manages cursor behavior and appearance in different modes (default, pet, knife).  
  - Supports switching modes via UI buttons or conditions (e.g., object detection).  
  - Handles smooth cursor movement, including knife rotations and hand petting animations.  
  - Integrates with trail effects and color changes when interacting with specific objects.  
  - Plays sound effects and updates cursor visuals based on user input and mode state.  
* cursorUI.cs  
  - Manages UI interactions for switching cursor modes (pet and knife).  
  - Connects UI buttons to corresponding mode toggle functions in the `CursorScript`.  
  - Tracks whether a mode decision has been made with a `decisionMade` flag.  
  - Provides methods to check and reset the `decisionMade` state.  
* Cut\_Action.cs	  
  - Update: Checks cursor state. On mouse button down creates cut (on sprite only).  
  - TakeDamage: Changes pig face, plays sound effect. Increases damage & damage bar. Triggers explosion.  
  - Handles the cutting mechanic for the pig, including cut marks and health reduction.  
  - Tracks the path of cuts and instantiates cut marks with random sprites and rotations.  
  - Scales cut marks dynamically based on the time spent dwelling at a position.  
  - Reduces the pig's health upon cuts, updates a health bar UI, and triggers effects (sad face, sound, explosion) when health reaches zero.  
  - Integrates with the pig's behavior and ensures cutting actions are valid only under certain conditions (knife mode active, cursor over the pig, etc.).  
* CutsceneEndHandler.cs  
  - Monitors the playback of a video player.  
  - Disables the cutscene GameObject when the video ends.  
  - Utilizes the `loopPointReached` event of the `VideoPlayer` component to detect video completion.  
* gameTimer.cs  
  - Tracks the elapsed time since the game started using `Time.deltaTime`.  
  - Logs the total time passed in the console when the current scene is "End\_Cutscene."  
  - Includes a method to retrieve the elapsed time (`getTimeElapsed`).  
* HoverPopUp.cs  
  - Manages a hover-based tooltip system using a singleton pattern.  
  - Displays a tooltip with a custom message at runtime via `SetandShowToolTip`.  
  - Hides the tooltip and clears its content when `HideToolTip` is called.  
  - Ensures only one instance of the tooltip exists and starts hidden by default.  
* nametag.cs  
  - Holds and assigns a name to a pig from a predefined list of names.  
  - Includes a placeholder method (`updateName`) for dynamically updating the pig's name, but it is not yet implemented.  
  - Displays the pig's name using a `TMP_Text` component.  
* ParticleSpriteManager.cs  
  - Manages particle effects and dynamically updates particle sprites based on assigned items.  
  - Spawns and updates a visual representation (`ItemSpawn`) of the current sprite item.  
  - Animates particles to move toward a designated endpoint (`EndPoint`) with adjustable speed.  
  - Integrates with a `PigManager` and `spriteSwitch` for item-specific logic and sprite management.  
  - Includes methods to update particle sprites (`UpdateParticleSprite`), display item sprites (`ShowItemSprite`), and reset items (`RemoveItemSprite`).  
* PigBehavior.cs  
  - Handles the behavior of the pig upon reaching maximum damage.  
  - Triggers a particle explosion effect when the pig "dies."  
  - Assigns a specific sprite to the particle system via the `ParticleSpriteManager`.  
  - Starts a coroutine to delay the pig's removal from the screen after the particle effect finishes.  
  - Integrates with `PigManager` to manage pig removal.  
* PigManager.cs  
  - Manages the spawning, movement, and removal of pigs in a queue system.  
  - Randomizes and assigns sprites for pig items and nametags from predefined lists.  
  - Handles the conveyor movement of pigs to a designated endpoint and off-screen after interaction.  
  - Tracks whether the current pig is in position (`isPigInPos`) for interaction.  
  - Transitions to the next scene (`End_Cutscene`) when all pigs have been processed or saved.  
  - Coordinates pig behavior, item assignment, and cursor interaction through dependencies like `PigBehavior`, `cursorUI`, and `spriteSwitch`.  
* pigsKilledUpdater.cs  
  - Calculates and displays the number of pigs killed over time based on a fixed rate (`pigsKilledPerSec`).  
  - Updates a `TextMeshProUGUI` element in real-time to show the cumulative number of pigs killed.  
  - Activates an `endButton` when the count reaches or exceeds a threshold (2750).  
* PigSwitchSprite.cs  
  - Manages the pig's pain overlay and sound effects when interacted with.  
  - Activates the overlay and plays a sound when the knife cursor is within range and a click is detected.  
  - Tracks knife proximity using `OnMouseEnter` and `OnMouseExit` to toggle the `knifeInRange` state.  
* SceneTransitionManager.cs  
  - Automatically transitions to a specified scene after a delay.  
  - Uses the `Invoke` method to schedule the scene load based on the `delay` parameter.  
  - Loads the scene specified in `nextSceneName` when the delay ends.  
* spriteSwitch.cs  
  - Dynamically updates UI elements (sprite, heading, description) based on selected pig-related items.  
  - Uses a predefined list of item names, textures, headings, and descriptions to map items to their corresponding details.  
  - Displays detailed information about an item when selected, such as its uses or production process.  
  - Includes a method to check and set the appropriate index for a sprite based on its name (`CheckSprite`) and to update the displayed content (`UpdateSprite`).  
  - Can activate or deactivate the information UI panel (`gameobject`) using `OnClick` and `OnExit` methods.  
  - Provides functionality to integrate with a list of items (`PassingList`) for dynamic use.  
* UIPanelMover.cs  
  - Manages the movement of a UI panel between its original position and a target position.  
  - Moves the panel to the target position when the pig is in position and no decision has been made.  
  - Returns the panel to its original position when the pig is out of position or a decision has been made.  
  - Uses smooth interpolation (`Lerp`) to animate the panel's movement and ensure a smooth transition.  
  - Tracks whether the panel is in position (`isInPos`) or actively moving (`isMoving`) to prevent redundant actions.  
* StartEnd.CS  
  - Provides functionality to navigate between scenes.  
  - Includes methods to load the "Start" scene (`LoadStartPage`) and the "Intro\_Cutscene(NEW)" scene (`LoadIntro`).  
  - Logs a debug message ("click") when either method is triggered.
